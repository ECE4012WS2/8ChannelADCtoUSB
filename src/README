Network format is a stream of unsigned 32-bit integers. The first integer is
the channel number, the second is the number of samples for the channel, followed
by the samples. This is repeated for each active channel. For example, sending
three samples with 2 channels active would look like:

channel = 1
size = 3
sample 1
sample 2
sample 3
channel = 2
size = 3
sample 1
sample 2
sample 3

Note: When calling sendSamples(), the size received for the even channels may
differ by 1 from the odd channels. However, it will be at least the number
of samples requested.
